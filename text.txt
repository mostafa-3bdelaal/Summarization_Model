Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars 
of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
He is best known for his mass–energy equivalenceformula, E = mc²,which has been dubbed 'the world's most famous equation'. 
He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his services to theoretical physics,particularly for his discovery of 
the photoelectric effect, a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.




Ahmed Hassan Zewail was born on February 26, 1946, in Damanhur, Egypt, and passed away on August 2, 2016, in Pasadena, 
California, USA. He was an Egyptian-American chemist and physicist, widely known as a pioneer in femtochemistry,
the study of chemical reactions on an extremely short timescale of 10⁻¹⁵ seconds, which allowed scientists to observe 
the movement of atoms during chemical reactions in real time. Zewail earned his Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry from 
Alexandria University in 1967 and his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1974. He then worked as a postdoctoral 
researcher at the University of California, Berkeley, and later became a professor at the California Institute of 
Technology (Caltech), where he made groundbreaking contributions to ultrafast science. In 1999, he was awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work in femtochemistry, earning him the title of the “Father of Femtochemistry.” 
Zewail also dedicated much of his life to promoting science and education in Egypt and around the world.
